# Symptom-Driven-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-for-Early-Diagnosis
This repository contains the code and resources for Symptom Driven Disease Predicton project using Random Forest,Decision tree and Naive Bayes.The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify symptoms into different diseases, such as Diabetics, Migraine, Malaria, Dengue, and more.

# Introduction
Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms is a system that predict a disease depending on the symptoms that the victim selects in the system and offers more accurate results based on the data given. Now a day’s the health area plays a vital role in decreasing victims illnesses, this system is really a helpful technique for the sake of health sector to tell the victim about the disease suffered by them.
The proposed approach uses tkinter  to create a user-friendly Graphical Interface. This Graphical Interface consists of a  box where the user can select their symptoms  what they are feeling, once done they can click on the predict button. After clicking, the predicted disease will be displayed on the interface.
To predict the disease Naïve Bayes, Decision trees, and Random Forest algorithm are used. After training the three models using these three algorithms, the most occurred disease will be considered as result. 

# Architecture
The model architecture used for symptom driven disease prediction is based on a random forest,decision tree and naive bayes. The input to the model is a symptoms  and the output is the predicted diseases.
